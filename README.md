===================

Storage/portfolio of the code I write working through the Coursera [data science series][1] offered by Johns Hopkins. Each completed course is represented by a subdirectory within this repo. As of now, I have finished:

* [The Data Scientist's Toolbox][2]
* [R Programming][3]

The courses are free and well-organized- I recommend them highly.
